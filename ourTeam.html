                <p class="cvsIntegrantes">Amr studied Law at Harvard University and graduated with honours, but then he realised he felt more comfortable working in a dark room from his home than in a courtroom. As a result of this revelation, he is now an excellent consultant: he'll know what is better for you even before you do. </p>

                <p class="cvsIntegrantes">Jose Miguel came from the dairy sector. In the 90's, he earned the MTV award "The Best Cheese-Maker in the World" with a cheese he created online. As it didn't really exist, no one could ever taste it, but as he always says: concepts are much better than facts. Nowadays, he is a valuous back-end developer.</p>

                <p class="cvsIntegrantes">Andrés Esteban went to visit a pshycoanalyst because when he was a child his classmates always refused to share their breakfast with him ("Pa ti no, Patiño", they would say). He is now recovered and working tirelessly, because he knows it's worth it and in the end he will get a breakfast and a salary.</p>

                <p class="cvsIntegrantes">Jael was abandoned in a circus when she was 2 years old because her parents were conviced she was an elefant. Unfortunatelly, they were wrong, and as she grew up, she tried to be a lion, a monkey and a person, but she failed. Now she makes us laugh with silly programming mistakes, and she is seriously considering to come back to the circus as a clown.</p>
